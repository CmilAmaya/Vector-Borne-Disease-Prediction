# ðŸ¤– Vector-Borne-Disease-Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of various vector-borne diseases based on a patient's symptoms. The application includes an interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to input symptoms and receive a predicted diagnosis. It features data preprocessing, model training, and an web app for disease prediction.
